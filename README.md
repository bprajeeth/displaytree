# **printree** - Python Package 

### **printree** is a **Python package** that allows us to **visualize our binarytree**.

## Compatibility ​​​🐍​
#### This package is compatible with both **Python 2** and **Python 3**

## Install ​🖥️​
```
 pip install printree
```
## Usage ​​📝​
```
from printree import binarytree
```
#### ``` binarytree(root_node, "right", "left", "value")```
- The above python syntax prints the binary tree in the shape/structure of the created tree, hence helping us to visualize our created tree.
> #### There are **Four arguments** that should be passed: 
> - **root_node** - Pass the root node of the created tree.
> - **right** - Pass the pointer attribute that points to the right node as a string. 
> - **left** - Pass the pointer attribute that points to the left node as a string.
> -  **value** - Pass the value attribute of the node which you want to be printed in each node of the tree as a string.

## Features ​​​🔥​
- No need to for any modification in the original python code.
- You can use your own NODE class for creating and operating your binary tree.
- Thus, helping us to add as many attributes in the NODE class that we require, that can be used in the future for other operations. 
- When a NODE is not present/NULL, it will be presented as ​​​❓​ the NULL  value.
- Equally spaced representation of the tree.
- Clean and elegant look for clear visualization
- Created with ​​​🧡​

## Operating Systems ​​​💾​
- Compatible with all major operating systems.
